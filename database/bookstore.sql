    values ('The Little Prince', 'Novel', ' A book to discover during childhood and re-read throughout your life. A must-read that highlights deep life topics like love, friendship, solitude, and the meaning of life. A young aviator crashes his plane in the middle of the Sahara Desert. In the isolation of the blistering sand dunes, he meets a strange little boy - the little prince. Over the next ten days, as the aviator tries to fix his plane on a fast depleting store of food and water, he also gradually learns the little prince''s extraordinary story. The little prince talks of his own tiny planet, his beloved rose, the serious threat of baobabs, and of his travels to different planets. As the sad experiences of the little prince''s life are unfurled, so grows the affection for him in the aviator''s heart. Antoine de Saint-Exupery''s classic text has enthralled its readers, adults and children alike, over decades. The story is reflective of notions of loyalty, friendship, love and hope, easy but intense. The little prince s simplicity throws the futility of endless human desires into a sharp relief, making it as profound as it is poetic.',

I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion. "A summer evening"s ghost stories, lonely insomnia in a moonlit Alpines room, and a runaway imagination -- fired by philosophical discussions with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley about science, galvanism, and the origins of life -- conspired to produce for Mary Shelley this haunting night specter. By morning, it had become the germ of her Romantic masterpiece, "Frankenstein." Written in 1816 when she was only 19, Mary Shelley''s novel of ''The Modern Prometheus'' chillingly dramatized the dangerous potential of life begotten upon a laboratory table. A frightening creation myth for our own time, "Frankenstein" remains one of the greatest horror stories ever written and is an undisputed classic of its kind.',

First published in 1925, this quintessential novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the mysteriously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted "gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession," it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.',

Macbeth himself, a brave warrior, is fatally impelled by supernatural forces, by his proud wife, and by his own burgeoning ambition. As he embarks on his murderous course to gain and retain the crown of Scotland, we see the appalling emotional and psychological effects on both Lady Macbeth and himself. The cruel ironies of their destiny are conveyed in poetry of unsurpassed power. In the theatre, this tragedy remains perennially engrossing.',

Narrated by Ishmael, a wayfarer who joins the crew of Ahab s whaling ship, this is the story of that hair-raising voyage, and of the men who embraced hardship and nameless horrors as they dared to challenge God s most dreaded creation and death itself for a chance at immortality.
                        A novel that delves with astonishing vigor into the complex souls of men, Moby-Dick is an impassioned drama of the ultimate human struggle that the Atlantic Monthly called "the greatest of American novels."',

                        In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.',
